## add SSH Agent
To use `eval` with `ssh-agent` in Linux, you can follow these steps:
1. Start the `ssh-agent` by running the following command in the terminal:
   ```
   eval $(ssh-agent)
   ```
2. Add your SSH private key to the `ssh-agent` by running the following command (ssh usually is located in home directory ~/.ssh):
   ```
   ssh-add /path/to/your/private/key
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/your/private/key` with the actual path to your SSH private key file.
3. Enter the passphrase for your SSH private key when prompted.
By running the `eval $(ssh-agent)` command, you start the `ssh-agent` and set up the necessary environment variables. Then, by using `ssh-add`, you add your SSH private key to the agent, allowing you to use it for authentication without having to enter the passphrase each time.

WINDOWS SSH
```ps1
$env:GIT_SSH_COMMAND = "ssh -i 'C:\Users\yourusername\.ssh\yourPrivateSSH_KEY'"
git push -u origin main -f -v
```

- make sure open ssh is not disabled in winows services.<br>

check if ssh-agent is running
```
Get-Service ssh-agent
```

Adding SSH-KEY make sure you have uploaded .pub key to github SSH keys
```
ssh-add path/to/your/key
```

- Troubleshooting:

test ssh connection
```
ssh -T git@github.com
```

check added list of ssh keys
```
ssh-add -l
```

remove ssh identities
```
ssh-add -D
```
